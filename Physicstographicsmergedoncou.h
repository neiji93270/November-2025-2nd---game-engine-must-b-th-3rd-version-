//resolve topological simplex of some sort.
//notice that we prevuously have five parameters 
//the expansion of parameters in the simplex could be efficient in cpu.
//but to keep video gale gonsoled aware of their cpus strength,
//we have to sutdown cpu threads before acting on those both entities because
//the heat transfer between them is not efficient.
//as a result, it is bezt to not use any shitdown algorithms on gddrram of gtaphics cards.
//a better way would be to hack direclty gpus. this is a loop ! so use a scheduller container inside
//the gddrram. this container would have 20000 bots on one layer. this would prevent using ai and
//then bios ai can act on gpus. this inceeqde graphic engine to 20 times more powerfull.
//in reverse, increasing physic engine force, we need brute force.
